### Project Description
A chaotic, colorful ‚Äú‡¥∂‡µç‡¥∞‡µÄ‡¥∞‡¥æ‡¥ú‡¥∞‡¥æ‡¥ú‡µá‡¥∂‡µç‡¥µ‡¥∞‡¥ø puzzle‚Äù where clicking one tile makes a different tile wobble, forcing you to deduce a secret mapping.
Reveal tiles strictly in order (1 ‚Üí 100 on a 10√ó10 grid). Wrong click after your first correct reveal? The whole board gleefully resets. Peek animation, wiggles, glow, confetti, and a tiny hand cursor keep it playful.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Modern puzzles are far too honest: click a tile and it politely responds. Where‚Äôs the mischief? Where‚Äôs the brain-bending chaos?
People also aren‚Äôt memorizing arbitrary bijections between grid cells nearly enough.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Every cell secretly maps to a different cell. Click here, watch over there. Learn the mapping, then lock tiles in strict order.
Add silly feedback: boingy sounds, wobbles, a celebratory confetti blast, and a wave ‚Äúpeek‚Äù that briefly shows the hidden picture‚Äîpure, impractical delight.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
-For Software:
- Languages: TypeScript, CSS (Tailwind)
- Frameworks: Next.js App Router (single page), React
- Libraries: canvas-confetti, shadcn/ui (Button), Tailwind CSS
- Tools: ESLint, Prettier, VS Code (recommended)
For Hardware:
- Main components: Any device with a modern web browser
- Specifications: Audio output for the boing SFX (optional), a pointing device or touch screen
- Tools required: None (unless you count a confetti broom)

### Implementation

Mapping mechanic: Generate a derangement array prankMap where click i highlights j = prankMap[i].
Game flow:
- Before the first correct move, probe freely to learn the mapping.
- Once you correctly reveal tile #1, any wrong click immediately resets the puzzle.
- Continue in strict order until all tiles are locked; on completion, confetti and a silly success overlay appear.

Visuals and feel:
- 10√ó10 grid, reduced gaps for density.
- Wiggle, shake, flip-in animations; tiny hand cursor; pulse ring on mapped cell.
- Peek wave animation reveals the full picture briefly without changing progress.

Image:
- Uses the uploaded image via its Source URL directly in CSS background-position slicing.
